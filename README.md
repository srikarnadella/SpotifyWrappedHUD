# Spotify Wrapped HUD
## Project Description
The Spotify Wrapped HUD project provides users with a personalized dashboard displaying their top artists, tracks, albums, and genres based on their Spotify listening history. This web application fetches data from the Spotify API using OAuth authentication, allowing users to visualize their music preferences and insights in a visually appealing dashboard format.

## Project Layout
The project is structured as follows:

* Components: Contains React components responsible for rendering different sections of the dashboard, such as top artists, tracks, albums, and genres.
* Styles: Includes CSS files for styling the dashboard components and ensuring a cohesive visual design.
* API Integration: Utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests to the Spotify API, fetching user-specific data such as top artists, tracks, and genres.
* State Management: Implements React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and handling side effects like data fetching.
* Responsive Design: Uses CSS Grid and media queries to ensure the dashboard layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
* Playback Feature: Integrates a play/pause button alongside top tracks, allowing users to preview track snippets directly within the dashboard.
### Technologies Used
* React: Frontend framework for building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
* Axios: HTTP client for making asynchronous API requests to the Spotify API.
* CSS Grid: Layout system used for creating a responsive and grid-based dashboard layout.
* OAuth: Handles authentication flow with the Spotify API to access user-specific data securely.

### Lessons Learned
* OAuth Authentication: Understanding OAuth flow and implementing it securely with the Spotify API.
* React Hooks: Practical use of useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and lifecycle events.
* Data Fetching: Handling asynchronous data fetching with Axios and managing state updates based on API responses.
* Responsive Design: Implementing responsive layouts using CSS Grid and media queries to ensure optimal user experience across devices.
### Future Improvements
* Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide more informative messages and better user feedback when API requests fail.
* Playback Controls: Expand playback functionality to include volume control and seeking within track previews.
* Data Visualization: Implement charts and graphs to visually represent music listening trends and statistics.
* Performance Optimization: Optimize API requests and component rendering for improved loading times and responsiveness.
